Monty Project:

- The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

- It works by reading a file line by line, and execute a function based on the first
  keyword in every line, and the file's extension is fileName.m

- There is not more than one instruction per line, There can be any number of spaces before or after the opcode and its arguments.

- we just build some functions to create and manipulate a stack.

- functions added to montys' project:
  push, pall, pint, pop, nop, swap, add, sub, mod, mul, div, pchar, pstr
